The Zabbix Configuration Exporter Tool is a command-line utility designed to export various configurations from a Zabbix server.

### How it works

1. **Prompt for Details**: The tool prompts the user to enter the Zabbix server IP, authentication method, and credentials.
2. **Export Choice**: Users select what type of configuration they want to export.
3. **Specify Directory and Format**: Users specify the directory where the exports will be saved and choose the export format.
4. **Export Process**: The tool connects to the Zabbix API, retrieves the selected configurations, and exports them to the specified directory. A progress bar shows the export progress.
